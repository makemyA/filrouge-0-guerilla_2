## Project Description

* Objective?

To be able to make a one page internet site in one working day

You can watch instructions [there](https://github.com/becodeorg/lovelace-2/blob/master/Projects/fil-rouge/phase-1.md)

* Morning

The site I received for improvement is this one ["BLED"-Berchem-Sainte-Agathe Local Et Durable](http://www.bled1082.be/news.php)

I begin to check the site and what kind of improvement I could execute.
To succeed this step I find a template on this site [html5up](https://html5up.net/dopetrope).
I lost a part of the morning to correct a bug with my linux subsystem on windows. It didnt recognize the files package template. I had to import it directly on my github repository and clone it after in my local reportory.

I test one template to discover the tool. Firstable I was afraid about the number of lines in the css module but after some hours to test different things I admit this kind of tool are really exciting to make internet site in a couple of hours.

* Afternoon

I  decided to switch my theme for the dopetrope theme. I didnt finish the exercice like i wanted to do but I will for sure give it an extra time during the evening and/or week end.

You can check the result here: [githubPage](https://makemya.github.io/filrouge-0-guerilla_2/html5up-dopetrope/), dont be too hard on the result. I have to improve my skills ;)
